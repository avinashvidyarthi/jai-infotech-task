#### This is a test task for JAI INFOWAY

  

- As per requirement, I have implemented a Redis based search on external endpoint. If the query params are in redis, it will return from there, else it will hit the external API and fetch the result.

  
- To run the project:
	1. Clone the repository
	2. Create & configure `.env` file as per `.env.example` in the root directory
	3. Run `npm install & npm start`
	4. See the console for server start message
